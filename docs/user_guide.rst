User Guide
##########

This document details the basic usage of the :py:class:`~alchemiscale.AlchemiscaleClient` for evaluating :py:class:`~gufe.AlchemicalNetwork`\s.
It assumes that you already have a user identity on the target ``alchemiscale`` instance, with access to :py:class:`~alchemiscale.Scope`\s to submit ``AlchemicalNetwork``\s to.


************
Installation
************

Create a conda environment on your workstation::

    $ conda env create openforcefield/alchemiscale-client

You can also use ``mamba`` instead of conda above if you prefer a faster solver and have it installed, e.g. via `mambaforge`_.

If this doesn’t work, clone alchemiscale from Github, and install from there::

    $ git clone https://github.com/openforcefield/alchemiscale.git
    $ cd alchemiscale
    $ git checkout v0.1.4-1

    $ conda env create -f devtools/conda-envs/alchemiscale-client.yml

Once installed, activate the environment::

    $ conda activate alchemiscale-client

You may wish to install other packages into this environment, such as jupyterlab.

.. _mambaforge: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge


Installing on ARM-based Macs
============================

If installing on an ARM-based Mac (M1, M2, etc.), you may need to use `Rosetta`_. You can do this with the following steps::

    $ CONDA_SUBDIR=osx-64 conda create -f devtools/conda-envs/alchemiscale-client.yml
    $ conda activate alchemiscale-client

*****************************
Creating an AlchemicalNetwork
*****************************

To create an :py:class:`~gufe.AlchemicalNetwork`, review this notebook and apply the same approach to your systems of interest: `Preparing AlchemicalNetworks.ipynb`_

Note that there are currently two Protocols you can use:

* :py:class:`openfe.protocols.openmm_rfe.RelativeHybridTopologyProtocol`
* :py:class:`perses.protocols.nonequilibrium_cycling.NonEquilibriumCyclingProtocol`

Try each one out with default options for a start. Below are notes on settings you may find more optimal for each, however.


.. _Preparing AlchemicalNetworks.ipynb: https://github.com/OpenFreeEnergy/ExampleNotebooks/blob/main/networks/Preparing%20AlchemicalNetworks.ipynb


RelativeHybridTopologyProtocol usage notes
==========================================

For production use of this protocol, we recommend the default settings, with these changes to reduce execution times per :py:class:`~gufe.Transformation` :py:class:`~alchemiscale.storage.models.Task`::

    >>> from openfe.protocols.openmm_rfe import RelativeHybridTopologyProtocol

    >>> settings = RelativeHybridTopologyProtocol.default_settings()
    >>> settings.simulation_settings.equilibration_length = 1000 * unit.picosecond
    >>> settings.simulation_settings.production_length = 5000 * unit.picosecond
    >>> settings.alchemical_sampler_settings.n_repeats = 1
    >>> settings.simulation_settings.output_indices = "not water"
    >>> settings.engine_settings.compute_platform = "CUDA"
    >>> settings.system_settings.nonbonded_cutoff = 0.9 * unit.nanometer


NonEquilibriumCyclingProtocol usage notes
=========================================

For production use of this protocol, we recommend the default settings::

    >>> from perses.protocols.nonequilibrium_cycling import NonEquilibriumCyclingProtocol

    >>> settings = NonEquilibriumCyclingProtocol.default_settings()


.. _user-guide-submit-network:

*************************************************
Submitting your AlchemicalNetwork to alchemiscale
*************************************************

Once you’ve defined an :py:class:`~gufe.AlchemicalNetwork`, you can submit it to an ``alchemiscale`` instance.
This assumes the instance has been deployed and is network-accessible from your workstation.
See :ref:`deployment` for deployment options if you do not already have an instance available for your use.

Create an :py:class:`~alchemiscale.AlchemiscaleClient` instance with and your user ``identity`` and ``key``::

    >>> from alchemiscale import AlchemiscaleClient, Scope, ScopedKey
    >>> asc = AlchemiscaleClient('https://api.<alchemiscale-uri>', user_identity, user_key)


Choosing a Scope
================

Choose a :py:class:`~alchemiscale.Scope` to submit your ``AlchemicalNetwork`` to. 
A ``Scope`` is an org-campaign-project triple, and your user will have permissions to work within some of these.
You can list your accessible ``Scopes`` with::

    >>> asc.list_scopes()
    [<Scope('org1-*-*')>,
     <Scope('org2-*-*')>
     ...]

If you are a user, you will likely see the ``Scope`` ``<Scope('openff-*-*')>`` among this list. 
This means that you can submit your ``AlchemicalNetwork`` to any Scope matching that pattern, such as ``'openff-my_special_campaign-tyk2_testing_1'``.
A ``Scope`` without any wildcards (``'*'``) is considered a *specific* ``Scope``; an ``AlchemicalNetwork`` can only be submitted to a *specific* ``Scope``.

You can create one with, e.g.::

    >>> scope = Scope('my_org', 'my_campaign', 'my_project')

Within a ``Scope``, components of an ``AlchemicalNetwork`` are deduplicated against other components already present, allowing you to e.g. submit new ``AlchemicalNetwork``\s sharing ``Transformation``\s with previous ones and benefit from existing results.
If you prefer to have an ``AlchemicalNetwork`` not share any components with previously-submitted ``AlchemicalNetwork``\s, then submit it into a different ``Scope``.


Submitting and retrieving an AlchemicalNetwork
==============================================

Submit your ``AlchemicalNetwork``::

    >>> an_sk = asc.create_network(network, scope)

This will return a ``ScopedKey`` uniquely identifying your ``AlchemicalNetwork``. A ``ScopedKey`` is a combination of ``network.key`` and the ``Scope`` we submitted it to, e.g.::

    >>> an_sk
    <ScopedKey('AlchemicalNetwork-66d7676b10a1fd9cb3f75e6e2e7f6e9c-my_org-my_campaign-my_project')>

You can pull the full ``AlchemicalNetwork`` back down (even in another Python session) with::

    >>> network_again = asc.get_network(network_sk)
    >>> network_again
    <AlchemicalNetwork-66d7676b10a1fd9cb3f75e6e2e7f6e9c>

You can always produce a ``ScopedKey`` from its string representation with ``ScopedKey.from-str(<scoped-key-str>)``, allowing for copy-paste from one session to another.

You can list all your accessible ``AlchemicalNetworks`` on the ``alchemiscale`` instance with::

    >>> asc.query_networks()
    [<ScopedKey('AlchemicalNetwork-4617c8d8d6599124af3b4561b8d910a0-my_org-my_campaign-my_project')>,
     <ScopedKey('AlchemicalNetwork-d90bd97079cd965b887b373307ea7bab-my_org-my_campaign-my_project')>,
     <ScopedKey('AlchemicalNetwork-d90bd97079cd965b887b373307ea7bab-my_org-my_campaign-my_project')>,
     ...]

and you can use these with :py:meth:`~alchemiscale.AlchemiscaleClient.get_network` above to pull them down as desired.


.. _user-guide-create-tasks:

****************************
Creating and actioning Tasks
****************************

Submitting an ``AlchemicalNetwork`` defines it on the ``alchemiscale`` server, but it does not define where to allocate effort in evaluating the ``Transformation``\s in the network.
To do this, we need to create and action ``Task``\s on the ``Transformation``\s we are most interested in.

For this example, we’ll loop through every ``Transformation`` in our ``AlchemicalNetwork``, creating and actioning 3 ``Task``\s for each::

    >>> tasks = []
    >>> for tf_sk in asc.get_network_transformations(an_sk):
            tasks.extend(asc.create_tasks(tf_sk, count=3))
    
    >>> asc.action_tasks(tasks, network_sk)
    [<ScopedKey('Task-06cb9804356f4af1b472cc0ab689036a-my_org-my_campaign-my_project')>,
     <ScopedKey('Task-129a9e1a893f4c24a6dd3bdcc25957d6-my_org-my_campaign-my_project')>,
     <ScopedKey('Task-157232d7ff794a0985ebce5055e0f336-my_org-my_campaign-my_project')>,
     ...]

A ``Task`` is associated with a ``Transformation`` on creation, and actioning the ``Task`` marks it for execution for our ``AlchemicalNetwork`` we submitted earlier.
If we submit another ``AlchemicalNetwork`` including some of the same ``Transformation``\s later to the same ``Scope``, we could get the ``Task``\s for each ``Transformation`` and only create new ``Task``\s if necessary, actioning the existing ones to that ``AlchemicalNetwork`` as well::

    >>> tasks = []
    >>> for tf_sk in asc.get_network_transformations(other_network_sk):
    >>>     existing_tasks = asc.get_transformation_tasks(tf_sk)
    >>>     tasks.extend(asc.create_tasks(transformation_sk, count=max(3 - len(existing_tasks), 0)) 
                         + existing_tasks)

    >>> asc.action_tasks(tasks, other_network_sk)
    [<ScopedKey('Task-06cb9804356f4af1b472cc0ab689036a-my_org-my_campaign-my_project')>,
     <ScopedKey('Task-129a9e1a893f4c24a6dd3bdcc25957d6-my_org-my_campaign-my_project')>,
     <ScopedKey('Task-157232d7ff794a0985ebce5055e0f336-my_org-my_campaign-my_project')>,
     None,
     ...]

The more ``AlchemicalNetwork``\s a ``Task`` is actioned to, the higher its chances of being picked up by a compute service.
In this way, actioning is an indicator of demand for a given ``Task`` and its corresponding ``Transformation``.

.. note:: About ``Task``\s

    Alchemiscale ``Task``\s can be considered a single independent “repeat” of an alchemical transformation, or a :py:class:`~gufe.protocols.ProtocolDAG` as defined in :py:mod:`gufe`.
    What this exactly means will be subtly different depending on the type of alchemical ``Protocol`` employed.
    
    In the case of the :py:class:`~openfe.protocols.openmm_rfe.RelativeHybridTopologyProtocol` (i.e. for HREX, and SAMS), this effectively means that each ``Task`` carries out all the computation required to obtain a single estimate of the free energy (in practice one would want to do several repeats to get an idea of the sampling error).
    
    In the case of the :py:class:`~perses.protocols.nonequilibrium_cycling.NonEquilibriumCyclingProtocol`, a ``Task`` instead encompasses a non-equilibrium cycle and will return a single work estimate.
    The work values of multiple ``Task``\s can then be gathered to obtain a free energy estimate, and more ``Task``\s will improve the convergence of the estimate.


********************************
Getting the status of your Tasks
********************************

As you await results for your actioned ``Task``\s, it’s often desirable to check their status to ensure they are running or completing at the rate you expect.
You can quickly obtain statuses for all Tasks associated with various levels, including:

* ``Scope``
* ``AlchemicalNetwork``
* ``Transformation``


Scope
=====

For example, to get the status counts for all ``Task``\s within a particular ``Scope``, you could do::

    >>> # corresponds to the scope 'my_org-my_campaign-*'
    >>> asc.get_scope_status(Scope('my_org', 'my_campaign'))
    {'complete': 324,
     'error': 37,
     'invalid': 6,
     'deleted': 13,
     'waiting': 372,
     'running': 66}

For a *specific* ``Scope``, this will give status counts of all ``Task``\s within that exact ``Scope``, assuming your user has permissions on it (see :py:meth:`~alchemiscale.AlchemiscaleClient.list_scopes` for your accessible ``Scope`` space).
For a *non-specific* ``Scope`` (like ``my_org-my_campaign-*`` above), this will give the aggregate status counts across the ``Scope`` space visible to your user under the given ``Scope``.

Calling :py:meth:`~alchemiscale.AlchemiscaleClient.get_scope_status` without arguments will default to the highest non-specific ``Scope`` of ``*-*-*``.

To get the individual statuses of all ``Task``\s in a given ``Scope``, use the :py:meth:`~alchemiscale.AlchemiscaleClient.query_tasks` method in combination with :py:meth:`~alchemiscale.AlchemiscaleClient.get_tasks_status`::

    >>> tasks = asc.query_tasks(scope=Scope('my_org', 'my_campaign'))
    >>> asc.get_tasks_status(tasks)
    ['complete',
     'complete',
     'complete',
     'waiting',
     'complete',
     'error',
     'invalid',
     'running',
     'deleted',
     'complete'
     ...]


AlchemicalNetwork
=================

You can get the status counts of all ``Task``\s associated with ``Transformation``\s within a given ``AlchemicalNetwork`` with::

    >>> asc.get_network_status(an_sk)
    {'complete': 138,
     'error': 14,
     'invalid': 2,
     'deleted': 9,
     'waiting': 57,
     'running': 33}

Note that this will show status counts for all such ``Task``\s, whether or not they have been actioned on the given ``AlchemicalNetwork``.

To get the specific statuses of all ``Task``\s for a given ``AlchemicalNetwork``, use the :py:meth:`~alchemiscale.AlchemiscaleClient.get_network_tasks` method in combination with :py:meth:`~alchemiscale.AlchemiscaleClient.get_tasks_status`::

    >>> tasks = asc.get_network_tasks(an_sk)
    >>> asc.get_tasks_status(tasks)
    ['complete',
     'error',
     'waiting',
     'complete',
     'running',
     'running',
     'deleted',
     'invalid',
     ...]


Transformation
==============

To get the status counts of all ``Task``\s associated with only a given ``Transformation``, use::

    >>> asc.get_transformation_status(tf_sk)
    {'complete': 2,
     'error': 1,
     'running': 3}

To get the specific statuses of all ``Task``\s for a given ``Transformation``, use the :py:meth:`~alchemiscale.AlchemiscaleClient.get_transformation_tasks` method in combination with :py:meth:`~alchemiscale.AlchemiscaleClient.get_tasks_status`::

    >>> tasks = asc.get_transformation_tasks(tf_sk)
    >>> asc.get_tasks_status(tasks)
    ['complete',
     'error',
     'complete',
     'running',
     'running',
     'running']


******************************
Pulling and assembling results
******************************

A :py:class:`~gufe.protocols.Protocol` is attached to each ``Transformation``, and that ``Protocol`` defines how each ``Task`` is computed.
It also defines how the results of each ``Task`` (called a :py:class:`~gufe.protocols.ProtocolDAGResult`) are combined to give an estimate of the free energy difference for that ``Transformation``.

We can check the status of a ``Transformation`` with::

    >>> asc.get_transformation_status(tf_sk)
    {'complete': 2,
     'error': 1,
     'running': 3}

If there are complete ``Task``\s, we can pull in all successful ``ProtocolDAGResult``\s for the ``Transformation`` and combine them into a ``ProtocolResult`` corresponding to that ``Transformation``/'s ``Protocol`` with::

    >>> protocol_result = asc.get_transformation_results(tf_sk)
    >>> protocol_result
    <RelativeHybridTopologyProtocolResult-44b0f588f5f3073aa58d86e1017ef623>

This object features a :py:meth:`~gufe.protocols.ProtocolResult.get_estimate` and :py:meth:`~gufe.protocols.ProtocolResult.get_uncertainty` method, giving the best available estimate of the free energy difference and its uncertainty. 

To pull the ``ProtocolDAGResult``\s and not combine them into a ``ProtocolResult`` object, you can give ``return_protocoldagresults=True`` to this method.
Any number of ``ProtocolDAGResult``\s can then be manually combined into a single ``ProtocolResult`` with::

    >>> # protocol_dag_results: List[ProtocolDAGResult]
    >>> protocol_dag_results = asc.get_transformation_results(tf_sk, return_protocoldagresults=True)
    >>> protocol_result = transformation.gather(protocol_dag_results)
    >>> protocol_result
    <RelativeHybridTopologyProtocolResult-44b0f588f5f3073aa58d86e1017ef623>

This can be useful for subsampling the available ``ProtocolDAGResult``\s and building estimates from these subsamples, such as for an analysis of convergence for the :py:class:`~perses.protocols.nonequilibrium_cycling.NonEquilibriumCyclingProtocol`.

If you wish to pull results for only a single ``Task``, you can do so with::

    >>> task: ScopedKey
    >>> protocol_dag_results = asc.get_task_results(task)
    >>> protocol_dag_results
    [<ProtocolDAGResult-54a3ed32cbd3e3d60d87b2a17519e399>]

You can then iteratively create and action new ``Task``\s on your desired ``Transformation``\s based on their current estimate and uncertainty, allocating effort where it will be most beneficial.

*******************
Dealing with errors
*******************

If you observe many errored ``Task``\s from running :py:meth:`~alchemiscale.AlchemiscaleClient.get_transformation_status`, you can introspect the traceback raised by the ``Task`` on execution.
For a given ``Transformation``, you can pull down all failed results and print their exceptions and tracebacks with::

    >>> # failed_protocol_dag_results : List[ProtocolDAGResult]
    >>> failed_protocol_dag_results = asc.get_transformation_failures(tf_sk)
    >>> 
    >>> for failure in failed_protocol_dag_results:
    >>>     for failed_unit in failure.protocol_unit_failures:
    >>>         print(failed_unit.exception)
    >>>         print(failed_unit.traceback)

This may give you clues as to what is going wrong with your ``Transformation``\s.
A failure may be a symptom of the environments the compute services are running with; it could also indicate some fundamental problems with the ``Transformation``\s you are attempting to execute, and in this case trying to reproduce the error locally and experimenting with possible solutions is appropriate.
You may want to try different ``Protocol`` settings, different ``Mapping``\s, or try to adjust the components in your ``ChemicalSystem``\s.

For a given ``Transformation``, you can execute it locally with::

    >>> from gufe.protocols import execute_DAG
    >>> from pathlib import Path
    >>> 
    >>> transformation = asc.get_transformation(tf_sk)
    >>> protocol_dag = transformation.create()
    >>> 
    >>> testdir = Path('transformation-test/')
    >>> testdir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    >>> 
    >>> protocol_dag_result = execute_DAG(protocol_dag, 
    >>>                                   shared_basedir=testdir,
    >>>                                   scratch_basedir=testdir)
    >>>                                   
    >>> protocol_result = transformation.gather([protocol_dag_result])
    >>> protocol_result.get_estimate()
    >>> protocol_result.get_uncertainty()

Note that for some ``Protocol``\s, your local machine may need to meet certain requirements:

* :py:class:`openfe.protocols.openmm_rfe.RelativeHybridTopologyProtocol`: NVIDIA GPU if ``settings.platform == 'CUDA'``
* :py:class:`~perses.protocols.nonequilibrium_cycling.NonEquilibriumCyclingProtocol`: OpenEye Toolkit license, NVIDIA GPU if ``settings.platform == 'CUDA'``

************************
Re-running errored Tasks
************************

If you believe an errored ``Task`` is due to a random failure (such as landing on a flaky compute host, or due to inherent stochasticity in the ``Protocol`` itself), or due to a systematic failure that has been resolved (such as a misconfigured compute environment, now remediated), you can choose to set that ``Task``/'s status back to ``'waiting'``.
This will make it eligible for being claimed and executed again, perhaps succesfully.

Given a set of ``Task``\s you wish to set back to ``'waiting'``, you can do::

    >>> asc.set_tasks_status(tasks, 'waiting')

Only ``Task``\s with status ``'error'`` or ``'running'`` can be set back to ``'waiting'``; it is not possible to set ``Task``\s with status ``'complete'``, ``'invalid'``, or ``'deleted'`` back to ``'waiting'``.

If you’re feeling confident, you could set all errored ``Task``\s on a given ``AlchemicalNetwork`` with::

    >>> # first, get all tasks associated with network with status 'error'
    >>> tasks = asc.get_network_tasks(an_sk, status='error')
    >>> 
    >>> # set all these tasks to status 'waiting'
    >>> asc.set_tasks_status(tasks, 'waiting')
