Welcome to fah-alchemy's documentation!
=======================================


**fah-alchemy** is a package for running large scale free energy campaigns
on the `Folding at Home`_ (FAH) distributed computing platform. It is designed for 
maximum interoperability with the `Open Molecular Software Foundation`_ stack,
and is built on top of `OpenMM`_, `OpenForceField`_ and `OpenFreeEnergy`_. 

.. note::
   This software is pre-alpha and under active development. It is not yet ready
   for production use and the API is liable to change rapidly at any time.
