high-throughput alchemical free energy execution
#######################################################################

**alchemiscale** is a service-oriented execution system for ``AlchemicalNetworks``,
suitable for utilizing multiple compute resources,
such as HPC clusters, individual hosts, Kubernetes clusters, `Folding@Home`_ work servers, etc.,
to support large campaigns requiring high-throughput.

**alchemiscale** is designed for maximum interoperability with the `Open Molecular Software Foundation`_ stack,
in particular the `OpenForceField`_ and `OpenFreeEnergy`_ ecosystems. 
**alchemiscale** is fully open source under the permissive **MIT license**.

The overall architecture for **alchemiscale** is shown visually in :numref:`system-architecture-figure-overview`.
See the :ref:`user-guide` for details on what interaction with **alchemiscale** looks like from a user's perspective,
and the :ref:`developer-guide` for details on how the components of this architecture work together to execute free energy calculations and yield their results.
